I'm  a Computer Engineer 🚀 currently, I'm an associate ML Engineer at Bottle Technology. Also, i am Blogger 🙍🏽‍♂️ @ [AIHUBPROJECTS.COM](https://aihubprojects.com), Freelancer 👨🏽‍💻.

My interest in Artificial Intelligence began when I found myself fascinated by the projects done by seniors in one of the hackathons attended. My hunt for AI kept on growing. I took part in many hackathons and coding competitions. Similarly, during the sixth semester, I created an Instagram page (@aihub_) and a website named “aihubprojects.com” where I have shared various tutorials on Python, Machine Learning from scratch and AI Projects. It has become a platform to collaborate with various AI enthusiasts across the globe. We have built a freelance team of six people and have worked on various ML projects as freelancers. Some of the freelance projects I was part of were: employee attendance using face recognition, number plate recognition system for parking, creating a fake dataset of Japanese vehicle license plates, and face mask detection.

Currently, I am working as a team lead and associate ML Engineer at Bottle Technology. I am in charge of a team of four ML Engineers who are working on Devanagari OCR model preparation. We've already begun to make some headway on it. We are able to cut 30 minutes of  KYC fill up time down to 8 minutes. In addition,The project has been a milestone for me. It has helped me to understand the various aspects of Machine Learning Operation (MLOPs), including manpower handling and project management. Besides OCR, I have also worked on project ABC. I have contributed to photo extraction and enhancement from Citizenship, signature extraction from documents, and project deployment on EC2 and AWS serverless using lambda. Most recently, I have deployed a regression model which predicts the size of Leather jackets of individuals for a Latido store. Along with that, I am also leading a research team where we work on traffic data. We have installed a CC camera on the busiest street of Kathmandu where we analyze vehicle speed, traffic time and probable accidents.
