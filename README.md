I am Diwas Pandey, an aspiring graduate with an M.S. in Computer Science from Washington State University (current GPA: 4.00). My academic journey has equipped me with comprehensive knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Computer Vision. I hold a B.E. in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and bring practical experience from projects like real-time number plate recognition and bio-marker analysis from ECG data.

Eager to launch my career, I am actively seeking entry-level roles in Machine Learning. My research endeavors and hands-on projects have honed my skills in Python, C++, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, PyTorch, and AWS. As a Team Lead and Machine Learning Engineer II, I successfully led projects at Bottle Technology, Pvt. Ltd., enhancing Nepali Citizenship data and implementing a Smart Advertisement system. My entrepreneurial spirit is reflected in founding aihubprojects.com, where I authored a book, published articles, and collaborated with renowned institutions. I am excited about contributing my skills to a dynamic team and making a meaningful impact in the field of Machine Learning.
