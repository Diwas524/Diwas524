I am a Computer Engineer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence 🚀 Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Washington State University, WA, USA.
 Also, i am Blogger 🙍🏽‍♂️ @ [AIHUBPROJECTS.COM](https://aihubprojects.com), Freelancer 👨🏽‍💻.


My fascination with Artificial Intelligence started when I saw the impressive projects my seniors presented during a hackathon. This sparked my interest, and I delved deeper into AI. Participating in numerous hackathons and coding competitions further fueled my passion. During my sixth semester, I created an Instagram page (@aihub_) and a website called "aihubprojects.com." On these platforms, I shared tutorials on Python, Machine Learning from scratch, and AI Projects. They have become a hub for collaborating with AI enthusiasts worldwide. Together, we formed a freelance team of six talented individuals and worked on various ML projects.

I am currently engaged in my graduate thesis, titled "Biomarkers on ECG Data". For my graduate thesis, I am conducting a detailed analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data to identify pertinent patterns and characteristics that could serve as biomarkers. The study aims to highlight the vital role these biomarkers play in enhancing healthcare outcomes.
